# Deskribe
Declarative intent capture for infrastructure. Express what your app needs Deskribe handles the platform glue.

## Core Principle
“Describe what you need, not how to provision it —
but if you do know how, you can describe more.

Why Deskribe?
Because developers shouldn’t have to master platform tooling just to use essential cloud services, and platform teams shouldn’t spend their time reviewing repetitive YAML and Terraform.
Deskribe bridges the gap, so developers can focus on building features, and platform engineers can focus on evolving the platform.
